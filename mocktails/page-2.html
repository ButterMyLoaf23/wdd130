         <P>Shaking is a crucial step for many cocktails, and it's faster than stirring because the ingredients are repeatedly exposed to the ice. When shaking, it's best to use large ice cubes or chunks, as they melt more slowly than crushed ice and won't over-dilute the drink.</P>

            <p>This is a Jigger. This helps measure and ensure consistent drink flavors and prevents drinks from being too strong or too weak.</p>
