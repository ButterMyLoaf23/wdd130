            <P>Shaking is a crucial step for many cocktails, and it's faster than stirring because the ingredients are repeatedly exposed to the ice. When shaking, it's best to use large ice cubes or chunks, as they melt more slowly than crushed ice and won't over-dilute the drink.</P>

                    <p>The main function of a pourer is to provide a controlled and consistent flow of liquid when pouring from a bottle. By using a pourer, you can reduce spills and drips that can occur when pouring directly from a bottle without a controlled spout.</p>
