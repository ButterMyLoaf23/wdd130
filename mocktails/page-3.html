        <p>This is a picture of me bartending my first event, This is also the only image I have from that night. I was very nervous at first. However, as the night went on, I got compliments on my drinks and their presentation and I became more confident.</p>

         It all started when my mom was throwing a halloween party and needed to figure out how she was gonna serve drinks to the guests. I told her I could Bartend for her party. At the time I had no experience Bartending but I quickly learned how to use all the tools and proper methods for making drinks. I spent two months creating drinks and I had a lot of fun doing this. After the Halloween party my Mom threw I got offers from the guests to bartend their parties, and within two months I had four birthday parties that booked me to bartend for them. This was a lot of fun I got to meet a lot of cool people at those parties and I got a lot of compliments on my drinks and their presentation. I took a break from bartending for awhile so I can continue school, but I still practice making drinks in my free time and I want to start a business out of this after school.
