I have five drinks to showcase as of now and I'm working on making more. All of the ingridients for these drinks are common ingridents you can find at any store. These drinks are also very simple and easy to make it shouldn't take you more than five minutes to make any of these drinks.

        This Tools page will be where I will have a picture of every tool you will need for making drinks. some of these tools might not be needed for every drink but all of these tools are helpful in their own way for creating deicious drinks. some of these tools may not be available at your local store. However amazon has never let me down when I am looking for specific tools.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        This About me page will be where I explain why I started doing this and where my love for mixology comes from. It all started when my mom was throwing a halloween party and needed to figure out how she was gonna serve drinks to the guests. I told her I could Bartend for her party. At the time I had no experience Bartending but I quickly learned how to use all the tools and proper methods for making drinks. I spent two months creating drinks and I had a lot of fun doing this and after the Halloween party my Mom threw I got offers from the guests to bartend their parties and within two months I had four birthday parties that booked me to bartend for them. This was a lot of fun I got to meet a lot of cool people at those parties and I got a lot of compliments on my drinks and their presentation. I took a break from bartending for awhile so I can continue school, but I still practice making drinks in my free time and I want to start a business out of this after school.
